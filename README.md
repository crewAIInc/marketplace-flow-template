# Flow - Marketplace Template

Welcome to the Flow project template, designed for the [crewAI Marketplace](https://marketplace.crewai.com). This template provides a standardized structure for creating and sharing powerful multi-agent AI systems that others can easily install and use.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This template serves as a foundation for building marketplace-ready flows that:

- Are easily installable with minimal setup
- Follow best practices for crewAI implementations
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Can be seamlessly distributed through the marketplace

Approved templates will be featured in the CrewAI enterprise app, giving your creation visibility to enterprise users and the broader CrewAI community.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management, offering a seamless setup experience.

1. Install UV if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Install dependencies using the CrewAI CLI:
   ```bash
   crewai install
   ```

### Advanced Customization

- **LLM Flexibility**: Use any supported LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Custom Tools**: Create specialized tools for your agents
- **API Integration**: Connect to external services and data sources
- **Unique Workflows**: Design distinctive multi-agent systems that solve real problems

### Marketplace Submission Guidelines

When preparing your flow template for marketplace submission:

1. Ensure your README clearly explains what your flow does and what problem it solves
2. Include detailed instructions for any required API keys or additional setup
3. Provide examples of expected outputs or use cases
4. Test your flow thoroughly before submission
5. Consider adding screenshots or diagrams to illustrate your flow's workflow
6. Document any custom tools or specific LLM requirements

## Running Your Template

To test your flow and verify it works as expected:

```bash
crewai flow kickoff
```
